## Introduction

This project is designed to make language learning engaging and fun. Users get to explore different locations on a map and unlock doors by successfully completing language exercises. The game aims to improve vocabulary, grammar, and comprehension in a playful and interactive manner. I designed this game for children and young adults alike so people will be able to learn languages in a fun and motivating manner. I came up with the idea while attempting to learn a new language with my younger sibling, and I realized that at younger ages, children are more motivated to learn through games and exercises. As a result I developed this game, in which the player is able to alternate between pure language learning exercises and gameplay where they can explore the map with Patty. This alternation of gameplay will allow children to stay focused and speed the learning progression.
